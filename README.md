# DotNetGetDebuggableAttribute
Simple PowerShell script to get the DebuggableAttribute from the assembly manifest of files in a folder.
Not my best PowerShell :-) But it does the job.

## Usage:

Place file in the same folder as the EXE or DLL files to inspect.

Edit the filter on line 22 (currently *.exe)

Run!
